This repository contains my coding projects from physics and astronomy courses, independent work, and a research-focused astrophysics class. Most notebooks were created in Google Colab using Python, and some use MATLAB or tools like TOPCAT. These projects demonstrate scientific data analysis, visualization, and physics-based problem solving.

Projects
Galaxy Color–Mass Analysis

Tools: Python, numpy, matplotlib, astropy, TOPCAT

Analyzed large (~63k) galaxy datasets

Created color–mass diagrams and quiescent vs. star-forming contours

Compared large and small samples

Stellar Populations & IMF Modeling

Tools: Python, numpy, scipy

Modeled stellar populations using simplified IMFs

Computed mass fractions and plotted distributions

Other Physics & Astro Notebooks

(Quantum mechanics, cosmology, galaxy analysis, data cleaning templates, etc.)
More notebooks will be added here as the portfolio grows.
